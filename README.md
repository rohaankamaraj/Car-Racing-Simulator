# Car-Racing-Simulator

My first C++ OOP Project in CSE240. This software is a car racing simulator, using Object Oriented Programming. This race contains different racers and different terrains, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. The race continues until there is a winner. Finished on 11/15/21.
